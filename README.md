# Employee-Management-System
An employee management system (EMS) is a tool that helps companies improve employee productivity and satisfaction, and achieve their overall goals. 
An Employee Management System (EMS) project that is just intended for visualisation usually aims to present employee data in an intuitive graphical style, including personal information, status, performance, and other pertinent indicators. It is not a fully functional interactive program, but it can assist managers and decision-makers in quickly gaining insights into the workforce. 
1. Objective of the Visualization Employee Management System (EMS) Project:
The goal is to provide a visual representation of employee data to help track, analyze, and present key insights. This might include trends in performance, employee status, department distribution, etc., through charts, graphs, and other data visualizations.
2. Key Features of the Visualization EMS:
•	Dashboard Overview: A central dashboard that shows key statistics, such as:
o	Total number of employees.
o	Percentage of active vs. inactive employees.
o	Average employee performance score.
o	Number of employees by department.
•	Charts and Graphs:
o	Pie Chart: To show the distribution of employee status (Active, Inactive, On Leave).
o	Bar Chart: To display the number of employees in different departments or locations.
o	Line Chart: To show performance trends over time (e.g., average performance score per month).
o	Heatmap: For attendance analysis, showing which days of the week employees are absent or present the most.
3. Tools for Visualization:
•	Python Libraries:
o	Matplotlib: For basic charts and graphs.
o	Seaborn: For more advanced statistical visualizations (heatmaps, box plots, etc.).
o	Pandas: For data manipulation and preparing data before visualizing.
o	Numpy: Used for numerical & scientific programming.
4. Steps to Create the Visualization EMS:
1. Data Collection & Preparation:
•	Collect the employee data (this could be a CSV file or a database).
•	Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values and ensuring consistency (e.g., "Active" vs. "inactive" as strings, making sure performance ratings are numerical).
2. Data Analysis:
•	Perform any necessary calculations, such as average performance, the number of employees in each department, or attendance statistics.
•	For example, you can calculate the average performance score per month, or the total number of employees per department.
3. Visualization:
•	Create various visualizations using Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn:
o	Bar Chart for employee count in each department.
o	Pie Chart for employee status.
o	Heatmap for attendance data.
•	Conclusion:
•	An Employee Management System (EMS) for visualization only is a project that focuses on visualizing employee data to gain insights and support decision-making. It emphasizes creating charts, graphs, and dashboards that provide a comprehensive overview of key employee metrics such as performance, attendance, and departmental distribution. Such a system helps organizations track employee trends, identify potential issues, and make data-driven decisions.
